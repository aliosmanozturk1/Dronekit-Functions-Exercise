    Moves the vehicle to a position dNorth metres North and dEast metres East of the current position.

    The method takes a function pointer argument with a single `dronekit.lib.LocationGlobal` parameter for
    the target position. This allows it to be called with different position-setting commands.
    By default it uses the standard method: dronekit.lib.Vehicle.simple_goto().

    The method reports the distance to target every two seconds.
